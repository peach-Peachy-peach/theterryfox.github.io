    <hr id="line2">

    <p id="p4"> Terry was 18 when he was diagnosed with bone cancer. He got part of his leg amputated. He decided to raise money for research to cure bone cancer. He decided he would run accross Canada all by himself with his mechanical leg. The run started April 12th, 1980. His brother drove right beside his in an ambulance just in case. Sadly, However, on September 1st, after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 miles), Terry was forced to stop running outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario because cancer had appeared in his lungs. Terry passed away June 28th, 1981 at the age of 22. </p>
